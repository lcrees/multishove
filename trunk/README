Common frontend that lazily stores objects
in multiple objects storage backends simultaneously and supports
dictionary-style access, object serialization and compression, and
multiple storage and caching backends.

Currently supported storage backends are:

Amazon S3 Web Service

Berkeley Source Database

Memory

Filesystem

Firebird

FTP

DBM

Durus

Microsoft SQL Server

MySQL

Oracle

PostgreSQL

SQLite

Subversion

Zope Object Database (ZODB)

Currently supported caching backends are:

Memory

Filesystem

Firebird

memcache

Microsoft SQL Server

MySQL

Oracle

PostgreSQL

SQLite

The use of multiple backends for storage involves
passing multiple store URIs or instances to
multishove following the form:

<storename> = Shove(<store_uri1>, <store_uri2> ..., cache=<cache_uri>)

multishove's access API is the Python mapping API:

http://docs.python.org/lib/typesmapping.html

multishove requires the shove package from:
